        <h4> First off. How good does it look? Am I right?</h4>
        <li> I mean let's be honest, it looks good in every picture on the home page
            yet somehow manages to be in different stages throughout. Whether it's 
            curled up and bouncy after a fresh shower or has been kept under a hat all day,
            his hair still manages to look like he wanted it to be that way. Impressive feat.
        </li>
        <h4> Let's move on to that Volume</h4>
        <li> I'm not shocking anyone by saying this is a good head of hair. If you're here you know this already.
            That is specifically the key. This dudes hair is nice and thick. I admittedly don't know Whether
            this guy gets his hair permed or not, but regardless, you don't get that kind of volume without some good old fashioned 
            very blessed genes.
        </li>
        <h4> Honestly thought I would have more to say about his hair</h4>
        <li> But whatever, you get the point. I like this guys hair.
